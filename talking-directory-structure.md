# Talking Directory Structure

Many coding technical books I've encountered seem to talk about the `directory structure` that will be used in the project covered through out the book. As well as other available `directory structures` you may encounter in the open source/industry. Hence I've dedicated a file to highlight/outline the `directory structure` demonstrated in this book. Who knows maybe by documenting this fo each book I complete, I'll start to notice a pattern, or even see benefits or maybe criticism.
